**Mockup Functionalities**

 *Pages*

 **Homepage:** This is in the **firstpage.html** file. You can navigate around the site using the headings and the icons in the header.

 **Boys Heading:** Directs you to the boys shopping site contained in boyscloths.html.

 **Girls Heading:** Directs you to the girls shopping section contained in girlscloths.html.

 **Users Icon:** Directs you to the user registration page contained in register.html.

 **Home Heading:** Takes you back to the first page.

 **Item.html** and **cart.html** are independent files. They are linked to the other files but the other files are not linked to them. This means that you can navigate from them to the sections mentioned above but you cannot navigate to the two files from the other pages.
